An easy to use item editor for Hypixel Housing


Theres still a lot to be done, but heres some of the basic goals

* Most, if not every skull texture
* The .item/.items format
* *This is based on 1.20.4's item data format, and can easily be used to set the Items tag of a chest on this version
* Name & Lore editing
* Fireworks?
* Built in art generation?
